== Description ==
This plugin allows you to post a preview of any post for anonymous users before publishing it. Have you ever written a post with the help of someone who does not have access to your blog and needed to be able to view the article to comment on it before publishing it and do not want to have access to your blog's administration? This add-on takes care of this by generating a URL.
